# Image Classifier

The goal of this project is to train a image classifier to recognize different species of flowers using deep neural network. The final model can be incorporated into a phone application that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at.

## Installation

The packages used are:

- Torch
- Torchvision
- PIL
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Json

## Files and how to use them

- Image Classifier Project.ipynd contains load and process the image data, build and train the classifier based on pre-trained networks and use the trained classifier to predict image content.
- train.py includes training a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint.
- predict.py uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image.
- helper.py is for functions and classes relating to the model and utility functions like loading data and preprocessing images.
